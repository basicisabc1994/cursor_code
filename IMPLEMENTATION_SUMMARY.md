- Interactive and non-interactive modes
- Resource limit configuration
- Progress tracking and result visualization
- Integration with existing PDF processing pipeline

### 9. **Comprehensive Examples** (`main_loop/example_main_solver.py`)

- Interactive mode for custom objectives
- Demonstration of all major features
- Component testing and validation

### 10. **Integration Testing** (`test_main_solver.py`)
